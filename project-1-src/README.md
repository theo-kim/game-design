# Project 1: Make a Simple SDL 2d Scene

There are three "objects" in the scene. The Klingon Ship, the Enterprise Ship, and the stars. Truth be told, the stars are black and space is grey because I could not figure out how to set the color of the untextured object. Other than that, the Klingon ship encircles the Enterprise as it travels at Warp Speed.
