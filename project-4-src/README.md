# Project 4: Rise of the AIs

Humanity thought it could play God... boy were they wrong. The artificial intelligences evolved faster than they had expected and brought destruction and death to their mortal creators. Now they have escaped to space and look for a new planet to rain chaos onto. As the last surving human, and captain of the last spaceship sent out from the dying Earth, it is your mission to destroy all the AI ships before they can escape to warp speed.

Use WASD to control your ship and your mouse to aim your laser cannons (left click to fire). Don't get shot down! Can you destory all of the AIs before they run away?

### Developer's Note...
There is ONE edge case that causes a seg-fault and I can't seem to recreate it and test it, so if it happens please just try the game again :)
