# Project 5: Platformer

This is a simple Office themed platformer. You can choose to play one of four characters from the Office, each have different movement speeds, mass, and special abilities:

* **Michael Scott:** he can turn into Prison Mike and all enemies will run away from him (lest they get dragged into a meeting...).
* **Dwight Schrute:** he can throw beets that can kill enemies.
* **Stanley Hudson:** he screams "Did I studder?" and all enemies will kill themselves (out of fear)
* **Jim Halpert:** he has no special ability, but he's fast and jumps high

The goal of the game is to traverse each level and find all five reams of paper and not get caught by your boss. The bosses (enemies) will kill you if you touch them, but respawn automatically after five seconds. Like any platformer, you can kill them by jumping on them, or your can use an ability. But, beware. The bosses also have abilities:

* **Jan:** she takes her baby for a walk. While she has her baby out, if she is killed, you will also die.
* **Robert California:** he turns into your worse fear and reduces your movement speed by 30%.
* **Ryan Howard:** he add you to his list... Honestly, this ability does nothing, but it's better if he thinks you're scared...

### Controls:

Press `A` and `D` to walk back and forth. Press `SPACE` to jump and `Q` to use your ability. Your ability has a cooldown (it's different for each character) so use it sparingly.

### References:

The original PNG sprites came from [this source](https://www.pngfind.com/mpng/hJiihxw_the-office-pixel-art-pixel-art-the-office/). Small adjustments were made to add jumping, walking and ability animations. We intend to make our own sprites eventually.
