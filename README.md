# Intro to Game Design (Fall 2019)

**Theodore Kim (tk1931)**

This is the Repo for my Game Design Projects. To run them, download the ENTIRE repo. As of this commit, the repo only supports running on Mac. To compile for Mac, change into the directory for the desired project and run `make mac`. That should compile the source then also start the game.

On Mac, you may also need to install SDL and SDL_image using homebrew:

```
$ brew install sdl2
$ brew install sdl2_image
```
