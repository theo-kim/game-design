# Project 1: Simple 2D Scene

## Running

Since I was working on a machine without XCode, my project does not use XCode, instead, use g++ and make to execute the file with the following command:

```
make
```

This will compile the files and then execute. Note, this has to be done using the includes in the parent folder of this Git Repo. Alternatively, you can just copy and paste the code into an XCode project.
