# Project 2: Make a Game of Pong

Pong, one of the oldest video games. Who knew it was so complex to program it? Can you be the first to reach 5 points? This is a two player game that utilizes the 'W' and 'S' keys to move Player 1 up and down, and the UP and DOWN arrow keys to move Player 2. The ball will slowly speed up as the game progresses... so finish your opponent off quickly.
